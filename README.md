# eLitNotes

Notes from and files for [DHSI 2016](http://dhsi.org/). Most from the Introduction to Electronic Literature course, taught by Dene Grigar, M.D. Coverly, and Davin Heckman, but some from the ELO/DHSI/INKE joint keynotes and panels.

Includes a short electronic poem based on Nick Montfort's "Hexes."
